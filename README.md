# Information-retrieval-models

This repository describes four query likelihood language probabilistic models - Laplace, Dirichlet, and Lidstone smoothing to find relevancy between queries and the documents providing the answers to those queries. The data can be downloaded from here https://www.dropbox.com/s/z15xt8og1a7bt3q/coursework-1-data.zip?dl=0. This is a statistical approach to solving query-passage retrieval problems using natural language processing in Python.
